WHAT IS xtcc

xtcc is "Cross Tabulation Compiler" - intended to be a Market Research
for tool Data Processing. 

REQUIREMENTS for COMPILATION AND RUNNING
	
	You need the following
	1) yacc/bison - I have only tested with bison
	2) lex/flex - Again I have only tested with flex
	3) C++ compiler - and standard template library
	4) Make ( and maybe autoconf and automake in case you need to
		tweak things)
	5) dejagnu - if you want to run the testsuite

	Compiling should be easy on GNU/Linux, UNIX systems
		There is a configure script. you would type
		$ ./configure
		$ make
	The built program is called "xtcc"
	Currently the directory "test-inputs" contains a sample program
	inp12. After a successful build you can run the program as
	follows
		$ ./xtcc testsuite/inp12 sample2.dat

		The tables will be created in tab_.csv and  frequency
		counts in lst_.csv


PROPAGANDA

	* An almost C like syntax - no there are no pointers - but you
	  can create arrays and I have never felt the need for pointers yet.
	  	* The input language allows you to create functions and 
		* Strong type-checking. 
		* Also unlike quantum there are no label numbers for if 
		  conditions, or loops. 
		* you can define variables any where in the edit
		  section  
		* The language supports passing of variables to functions by
		  reference
	 * There is no limitation such as line length has to be less than 200
	   chars in length. This has been a cause of many crashes and
	   core dumps in quantum - in my work experience
	 * The program can read very large records - quantum could read
	   a maximum of 32768 bytes on most machines that I know - I
	   hold the record size in a long integer (32-bit)
	
CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE PLAN

NOTES:
	The program outputs a set of tables in a file TAB_.csv. This
	file can be opened by a text editor or most spreadsheet
	programs. The sample2.dat data file used in the testsuite is created by 
	"stubs/mk_data.C". Corresponding to the data file the program also creates
	"human_readable_data.csv" which is the same data as sample2.dat, but human readable.
	You can use this file to verify the output.

DOCUMENTATION

	I have started on the documentation, but it is lagging way
	behind - the sample input program should help though.
