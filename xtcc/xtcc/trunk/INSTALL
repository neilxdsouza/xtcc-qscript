Quickstart

Requirements
	1) g++ or Borland C++ for WINDOWS
	2) Gnu Make
	3) If compiling on WINDOWS you need The UnixUtils -> in particular sed and gnu Make
	4) bison/yacc
	5) lex/flex


Building:
	Type the following at the prompt
	$ ./configure
	$ make

Output:
	You will get the file "xtcc" binary which is the compiler. For now it will only run in the directory where it was built, but I intend to change that soon.

Best of Luck!!!
