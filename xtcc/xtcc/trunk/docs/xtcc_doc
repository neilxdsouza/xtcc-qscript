1 Overview_of_XtCC
******************

	XTCC - Cross Tabulation compiler, is a set of tools for Market Research
MR, companies to assist in Data Processing part of their day to day
work. DP -> Data Processing and a people working and this department
tend to be called DP(s). For an very brief overview of MR read mainly
from a DP point read the chapter "Overview_of_MR". The main program is
a compiler that takes user a user input program and applies the "edit"
to repeatedly to every line of data, after which it tabulates the data
based on the given tabulation spec.

   	The input program consists of 3 parts - an Edit section - containing
transformations you would like to apply to the data, the Tabulation
section marking the tables which need to be tabulated and the Axes
section listing each individual table in the program.

2 Overview_of_MR
****************

	Basic workflow:
  1. 	A client approaches an MR Company to research a particular topic

  2. 	A researcher in MR company interacts with the client - together
     they work out a questionnaire which will help answer clients needs

  3. 	The client commissions the study after which the questionnaire
     goes into field. The MR company looks at the target group, checks
     sample quotas that would make the information representable for
     the target group and does interviews - with (mostly) common people
     like you and me

  4. 	The questionnaires are collected and deposited in the data entry
     department of the company

  5. 	The Data processing department then gets the data punched by data
     entry programmers. There may be - pre or post cleaning of the data
     based on the choice of the MR company

  6. 	While data entry is on a DP person starts preparing the analysis
     specs for the program. If necessary she may write a cleaning edit
     to ensure that the data meets valid logical and quota checks that
     were in the initial field plan

  7. 	If there are open ended questions the DP or researcher - depending
     on whose responsibilty it is for that particular company will
     brief a Coder - person who looks at verbatim responses and
     classifies them for a statistical point of view

  8. 	Once all the data is entered, the DP will generate tables on the
     data, run her edits on the data, resolve and logical errors with
     the researcher, generate tables, check them against raw data using
     hole counts and finally send the output of the tables to the
     researcher.

  9. 	The researcher then studies the tables - looking for a specific
     pattern, and presents the findings to the client.

   	Although this might not be the way things happen in a particular
company, it captures the essence of what goes on.

   	The main role of a DP is converting raw data into information for a
researcher.

   For a DP the main work revolves around
  1. 	The questionnaire

  2. 	The questionnaires from field

  3. 	Giving a final set of 100% checked correct tables to the researcher

   	By Checking of tables against data most companies imply checking of
tables against hole counts. In most MR companies, data is punched in an
ASCII file. Every respodent has a unique identified the "Serial
number". Depending the format in which the file is written, a respodent
may have one or more "cards" per serial number. Each question asked by
the Field is given a unique column number in the data file - the card
number helps indentify a column number over a span of multiple lines
for a particular respondent. A holecount is a frequency distribution,
showing the data punched at each column number accumulated over all the
respondents. Given this information it is possible to check tables
against raw data.

   	For Example: 		if we know that Q1 is punched at column 59 in the data
file - by looking at the absolute counts at column 59 and seeing the
counts tabulated in Q1 - we can assert if Q1 is tabulated correctly by
a DP.

   	So suppose Q1 happens to be Respondents Gender where code 1 = Male
and Code 2=Female

   	The table output looks like: 	Q1 Gender 	Male 103
Female 110

   	The hole counts looks like 		code 1      code 2 	Col 59
| 103        110

   	By looking at the questionnaire - we can see that Male - is
represented by code 1 and Female by code 2, and looking at the table
and raw data - we can say that the information tabulated is correct.
