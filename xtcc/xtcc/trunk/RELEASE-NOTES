Release notes: xtcc-0.01 Pre-alpha 

This release has a program mk_data.C which generates the sample2.dat data file used in the test cases. It also creates human_readabable_data.csv which can be opened in a spreadsheet to verify the tabulation output.

The original grammar type.y has been split into 3 include files - we now use m4 as a pre-processor and generate "type.y" on the fly.
