* runtime isolation
* emscripten
** Compilation to html
*** DONE stdout file runs in browser
*** TODO Create nice UI for above working code in browser [/]
    Do this by
    - [ ] modifying emscripten/src/shell.html to have 3 divs for questions, stubs, answers
    - [ ] create a library function to accept the strings in Javascript
            (emscripten allows this), the parameter will be a json representation of the 
	    question text, stubs and codes
    - [ ] incorporate json parser in c++ runtime
    - [ ] pass the stubs , codes and question text to the js library as a json string
    - [ ] embed the json javascript parser into the shell.html 
    - [ ] from the javascript side parse the given material as question text, stubs and code
    - [ ] use pure javascript (from Professional JavaScript for web developers) to create 
            appropriate codes to display the text and stub lists as a form with single/multiple choices
    - [ ] replace cin call to extract user input with parsing form data and giving a submit button
    - [ ] replace hand created JavaScript widgets with Dojo Widgets for displaying survey choices
    - [ ] use emscripten FS calls to save the data to a file
