stub program to read a data file
this will later be embedded into the qscript classes to read a datafile from disk if a particular serial number was already entered previously and now needs to be edited

BUILD INTRUCTIONS:
$ make

	output-> read_data

TEST INTRUCTIONS:
$ ./read_data < j_1001_1.dat 
	where j_1001_1.dat is a datafile created by qscript
