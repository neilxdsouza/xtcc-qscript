Qscript is intended to be a questionnaire scripting language to capturing 
data for Market Research related projects.  When finished it will support
Pen and Paper, CATI and Web studies.

This is a demo of the qscript compiler. Given an input file, 
it creates a data entry program called test_script.c 
The input data entry program should then be compiled to generate 
the final binary.  These steps are listed below


This version of qscript can read a serial number from disk and 
allow you to review the data

"inp" is a sample input file for the demo script 
and should be included with the distribution



Step 1:
	make
		-> ouput will be simple_compiler
Step 2:
	simple_compiler -f inp	
		-> ouput will be test_script.c

Step 3:
	make -f QScriptMakefile
		-> ouput will be test_script ( a binary)

		step 3 uses test_script.c and re-uses certain *.o files 
		created in step 1 of the compiler
		to create "test_script" which can be executed

	
Step 4: 
	./test_script

		-> run the above command to see the data entry program in action
