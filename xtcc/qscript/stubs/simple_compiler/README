This is a demo of the qscript compiler. It creates a file called test_script.c 
The input data entry program should then be compiled after this point

Step 1:
	make
		-> ouput will be simple_compiler
Step 2:
	simple_compiler -f inp	
		-> ouput will be test_script.c

Step 3:
	make -f QScriptMakefile
		-> ouput will be test_script
		step 3 uses test_script.c and re-uses certain *.o files to create test_script which can be executed
