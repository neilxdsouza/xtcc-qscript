Qscript is intended to be a questionnaire scripting language to capturing 
data for Market Research related projects.  When finished it will support
Pen and Paper, CATI and Web studies.

This is a demo of the qscript compiler. Given an input file, 
it creates a data entry program called test_script.C
The input data entry program should then be compiled to generate 
the final binary.  These steps are listed below

This version of qscript can read a serial number from disk and 
allow you to review the data

"inp" is a sample input file for the demo script 
and should be included with the distribution
